OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an application programming interface (API) that supports
multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran on many
architectures, including Unix and Microsoft Windows platforms. It consists of a set of
compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time
behavior.

Jointly defined by a group of major computer hardware and software vendors, OpenMP is a
portable, scalable model that gives programmers a simple and flexible interface for
developing parallel applications for platforms ranging from the desktop to the
supercomputer.

An application built with the hybrid model of parallel programming can run on a computer
cluster using both OpenMP and Message Passing Interface (MPI), or more transparently
through the use of OpenMP extensions for non-shared memory systems.
